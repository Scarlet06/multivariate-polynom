# multivariate-polynom

This Project let you work with multivariate polinomials and has every operation needed to work fine with them.
RN it doesn't supports numpy and probably never will, for efficiency I suggest you to check [jannikmi's work](https://github.com/jannikmi/multivar_horner) it looks very good, but it asks you to have a C compiler too.

RN I'm working about finializing my examples and the Test file. Probably in the future I'll add a single variable polynomial sub-class that supports operations with multivariate polynomials.
It doesn't work with complex number, but I may update it in the future
